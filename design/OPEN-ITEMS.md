# OPEN-ITEMS.md

Live punch list. `ART-DIRECTION.md` owns intent and the rejected list;
`REFERENCE-LANGUAGE.md` owns measured composition. This file gets emptied as
items land.

Round one (A, B, C) is done. What follows is the second review, taken against
the build after the photograph reassignment.

The bar has not moved: this should read as an award-level site. Every item below
is judged against that, not against "is it acceptable".

## Order of work

Four phases, in this order. Photography first, because bad material makes every
composition look worse — and because several complaints below are the same
defect seen in different places.

1. **Photography** — quality, selection, and how frames are cut
2. **Transitions** — how one screen becomes the next
3. **Titles** — the inner-page headings
4. **About** — the page that still reads as arranged rather than composed

---

## 1 · Photography — done, with two carried

**1.1 · The rope macro comes out of the home hero.** Done. `home-youth` is off
the slideshow and off the site; three slides remain, at 4.5s each.

**1.2 · Two of the three remaining slides have lost quality.** Done, and the
cause was neither the grade nor the encoder. Every full-bleed frame declared
`sizes="100vw"`, but `object-fit: cover` paints a frame wider than its box
wherever the frame is proportionally the wider of the two, so the browser was
magnifying a variant chosen for the box: the ultra-wide slide was painted at
1928px from a 1600px file on a desktop and at 1808px from a 640px file on a
phone. `coverSizes()` declares the painted width; nothing on the site now
exceeds 1.0 rendered-to-intrinsic at either viewport.

What is not fixable in code is the sources. `hero-2` is 1536×2048 and `hero-3`
is 2560×1195 — 3.1 MP each, against `IMG_4585`'s 48 MP — so on a retina desktop
the two of them land at 1.875 and 1.506 where the third is at 1.125. That is
the whole of "two of three look softer". Measured: the grade costs `hero-2` 5%
in bytes and nothing measurable in high-frequency detail.

**1.3 · No frame may cut its subject.** Done for three of four. About's ground,
home's third plate and the finale's centre and widest tiles are recomposed on
whole subjects. `IMG_4582-road` at the panels' join is the fourth and it cannot
be fixed by panning — see *Carried* below.

**1.4 · The About finale's tile selection is wrong.** Two of the three
replaced, and the third is why the *Carried* list has a new entry: the usable
set is one photograph short of this page. `ART-DIRECTION.md` §8 carries the
arithmetic.

## 2 · Transitions

The individual screens are much better. What joins them is not.

**2.1 · The opening move.**
The hero's transition into the lede should arrive more naturally. It currently
reads as a mechanism rather than a movement.

**2.2 · "What we do" takes too long to show its picture.**
Scrolling into that zone, the screen is flat green first and the photograph
arrives late. The ground should not be visible on its own before the picture
that belongs to it.

**2.3 · The road at the panels' join arrives oddly.**
It appears mid-scroll in a way that reads as a jump rather than an arrival.

**2.4 · The handover into the panels reads as the picture leaving.**
Going into Youth Exchanges or Training Courses, the photograph departs and flat
green returns. The polarised ledger is right — the panels should be quiet — but
entering that quiet should be a dissolve, not a departure.

---

## 3 · Titles

**3.1 · Contact and About headings are too large.**
The FAQ heading was brought down and is now correct. Match Contact and About to
it.

---

## 4 · About

**4.1 · The page needs a photographic ground that moves.**
It should feel as though the reader is travelling through it, the way the
reference set does. At the moment each scene is a separate arrangement.

**4.2 · `ART-DIRECTION.md §6` applies here in full.**
One photograph treated two ways, type bound into the picture's depth, an organic
edge, a title that becomes a label, a deliberate seam. That is the standard for
this page.

## Carried, not yet solved

- **`REFERENCE-LANGUAGE.md §A2`** was corrected after `c61f320` widened the panel
  photograph until it filled the screen. The panels are reopened and awaiting a
  design decision — the geometry underneath them is sound and must not be
  discarded.
- **Landscape sources.** A 3:4 portrait frame full-bleed in a 16:10 window can
  never show more than 47% of its area. About and FAQ need landscape photographs
  to clear the 60% floor. Photography, not code.
- **The set is one frame short.** Thirteen usable photographs; the About page
  alone needs eleven distinct ones. After the three tiles that did not stand on
  their own came out, ten qualified. `hero-2` therefore takes a third placement
  and `IMG_4599` stays on the wall re-cut rather than replaced. Photography.
- **The chain-link fence** is still in the road frame. It is crossed rather
  than stopped on now, but it is also why that frame holds no complete subject
  at either viewport: every pan that reaches the landscape reaches the fence,
  and the pan that clears the most of it is road surface. Only a different
  photograph closes it.
- **Overhead cable in `hero-2`**, visible on the home hero's second slide and
  on the FAQ ground. The About tile is cropped clear of it; those two cannot
  be, since both are the whole frame full-bleed.
- **No device testing.** Nothing since the dark world landed has been confirmed
  on a real phone.
